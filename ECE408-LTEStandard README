This project is an attempt to model resource allocation and OFDMA in the LTE standard downlink.

INPUTS:
To run this simulation, choose either 16 or 64 QAM modulation at input request.
Then choose either 0 or 10 SNR at input request.

OUTPUTS:
Scatterplots showing the bits in the symbol after each stage of the modulation will appear.
The BER is computed for each block of symbols and printed. 
A plot of the Peak to Average Power Ratio Cumulative Distriution Function is displayed. 

The script was written with MATLAB R2019b.

NOTE: Intermittantly the script sends a reshape error. I am still locating th source. If this error occurs, try to run the program again.
